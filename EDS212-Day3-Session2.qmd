```

## Vectors in R

```{r}

# Every vector in R is the same class, the line below has 3 character a numeric and a logical value, so R will make them all characters because that is the best was to contain all the values for the vector
marmots <- c("blue", "green", 4, "yellow", TRUE)
#Check the class if youre unsure
class(marmots)
#when you call the vector, you can see everything has quotes around it which makes them characters
marmots

```

```{r}
# Create and store the vector: 
pika <- c(12.4, 6.8, 2.9, 8.8, 5)

# Return it:
pika
class(pika)
```

```{r}
# Create the integer vector:
bear <- c(20L, 3L, 5L, 18L, 23L)

# Look at it:
bear

# Check the class:
class(bear) 
```
